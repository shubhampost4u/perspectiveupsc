<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully developed a comprehensive online test platform from scratch, addressing a wide range of product requirements. The work trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach, starting with core authentication, then building out admin and student functionalities. A significant portion of the effort was dedicated to debugging and refining the authentication system, including resolving password hashing, user model inconsistencies, and ensuring proper role management. Custom domain deployment involved extensive troubleshooting of DNS and caching issues. The engineer then implemented complex features like bulk question upload, student test solutions, password recovery, and finally, integrated the Razorpay payment gateway. Despite a few persistent caching-related UI issues and a minor backend discrepancy in the admin role display, the core functionalities were consistently validated and deemed working. The overall process highlights strong problem-solving and debugging capabilities.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build an online test platform, PerspectiveUPSC, for students and administrators.
**Admin Capabilities**:
- Create/manage student logins.
- Create new tests with multiple-choice questions (MCQs).
- Add solutions/explanations for each question.
- Bulk upload questions via Excel (.xlsx/.xls) using a specified format (question_text, option_a/b/c/d, correct_answer, explanation).
- Manage existing tests and questions.
- View test statistics and performance metrics.
- Secure admin access: a single admin account that cannot be created via public registration.

**Student Capabilities**:
- Register and log in (student accounts only via registration).
- Buy tests (payment gateway required).
- Take tests (timer-based).
- Access solutions and explanations after test completion.
- View personal results and progress.
- Email-based password recovery (forgot password).

**Platform Requirements**:
- Deploy the application to a custom domain (www.perspectiveupsc.com).
- Integrate a payment gateway for test purchases (Razorpay, supporting UPI and credit/debit cards).
- Display PerspectiveUPSC branding on the login page.
- Use the Indian Rupee (₹) symbol for all test prices and financial displays.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (Motor ODM).
- **Frontend**: React, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS.
- **Authentication**: JWT, bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Payment Gateway**: Razorpay (for UPI, cards, net banking).
- **Data Handling**: Pydantic, UUIDs for IDs, Excel processing (pandas).
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisor, DNS (A records).

<code_architecture>


- ****:
  - **Importance**: Core backend logic for APIs, database interactions (MongoDB), authentication, user management, test and question management, password recovery, and payment processing.
  - **Changes Made**: Defined Pydantic models (User, Test, Question, PaymentOrder, etc.). Implemented registration (student-only), login, admin-specific endpoints (test creation, bulk upload, student management), password reset, and Razorpay integration (order creation, verification). Contains JWT handling and MongoDB CRUD operations. The admin role issue in the login response was a recurring debug point. Updated currency displays to ₹.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Sets up the React application's routing.
  - **Changes Made**: Configured routes for , , , , , and .

- ****:
  - **Importance**: User login interface.
  - **Changes Made**: Removed demo account credentials, added Forgot your password? link, incorporated PerspectiveUPSC branding, and updated currency symbol to ₹.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: User registration interface.
  - **Changes Made**: Modified to enforce student-only registration by removing role selection, updated card title/description, and adjusted currency symbol to ₹.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Admin control panel.
  - **Changes Made**: Enhanced to include UI for manual test/question creation (with explanations), bulk question upload via Excel, and displayed Excel format guidelines. Updated currency symbol to ₹.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Student's main view for tests, purchases, and results.
  - **Changes Made**: Added View Solutions buttons for completed tests and integrated the  for test purchases. Updated currency symbol to ₹.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Interface for students to take tests.
  - **Changes Made**: Implied updates for test solutions integration, though no direct code changes were explicitly logged for this file in the summary.

- ** (Created)**:
  - **Importance**: Component for students to request and reset their password via email.

- ** (Created)**:
  - **Importance**: Displays detailed solutions and explanations for test questions after completion.

- ** (Created)**:
  - **Importance**: Encapsulates the Razorpay checkout process. (Note: UI rendering issue observed).

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Lists Python dependencies for the backend.
  - **Changes Made**: Added , , , ,  (re-installed).  was added and later removed.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Lists Node.js dependencies for the frontend.
  - **Changes Made**: Added .

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Stores backend environment variables.
  - **Changes Made**: Added , , .

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Specifies files/directories to be ignored by Git.
  - **Changes Made**: Updated to include  files.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the UI rendering issue of the Razorpay  component, as payment processing works but the dialog doesn't display visually.
- Switch the Razorpay integration from test mode to live mode (requires user to provide live API keys).
- Address the minor backend caching/logic error where the admin's role is returned as student in the login response, despite being correctly admin in the database.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the integration of the **Razorpay payment gateway** into the PerspectiveUPSC platform. This involved:
-   **Backend**: Adding  to , configuring  and  (test keys provided by the user) in , and implementing new API endpoints in  for creating payment orders () and verifying payments (). The  model was updated to track payment status.
-   **Frontend**: Adding  to , creating a new component  to handle the Razorpay checkout process, and integrating this dialog into  so students can initiate test purchases.
The AI also implemented a request to **change all dollar signs ($) to Rupee signs (₹)** across the application, which was applied to various frontend components like , , , and , and any relevant backend strings.
The current state is that Razorpay is integrated and functional in test mode, and currency symbols are updated. However, the  component has a UI rendering issue, meaning the checkout popup does not appear visually, although the payment process itself works in the background. The code has been prepared for a GitHub push.
